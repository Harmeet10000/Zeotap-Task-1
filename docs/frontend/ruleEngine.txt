RuleEngine.jsx Documentation
=============================

This file contains the frontend logic for interacting with the RuleEngine. 
The RuleEngine.jsx component likely handles the user interface for creating, 
evaluating, and managing rules in the frontend of the application.

---

1. Overview
-----------
The `RuleEngine.jsx` file serves as the interface between the user and the backend 
Rule Engine. It might provide functionalities such as:

- Form input for creating rules.
- Options to evaluate existing rules.
- Visual representation of the rule states or statuses.
- Integration with backend API calls for CRUD operations on rules.

---

2. Expected Functionalities
----------------------------
1. **Creating Rules**:
   - Users can input rule names and expressions.
   - Rules are sent to the backend via API calls.

2. **Evaluating Rules**:
   - Users can provide input data to evaluate rules.
   - The result (eligible or not) is displayed on the UI.

3. **Fetching Rules**:
   - Displays a list of rules fetched from the backend.
   - Option to select and view individual rules.

4. **Combining Rules**:
   - Users can combine multiple rules into one through a UI action.
   - Combined rule is sent to the backend.

3. Example Code Snippet (Hypothetical)
--------------------------------------
```javascript
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { RuleService } from "../services/ruleAPI";

const RuleEngine = () => {
  const [ruleName, setRuleName] = useState("");
  const [ruleString, setRuleString] = useState("");

  const handleCreateRule = async () => {
    try {
      const result = await RuleService.createRule(ruleName, ruleString);
      console.log("Rule created:", result);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error creating rule:", error);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Create a New Rule</h1>
      <input
        type="text"
        placeholder="Rule Name"
        value={ruleName}
        onChange={(e) => setRuleName(e.target.value)}
      />
      <input
        type="text"
        placeholder="Rule String"
        value={ruleString}
        onChange={(e) => setRuleString(e.target.value)}
      />
      <button onClick={handleCreateRule}>Create Rule</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default RuleEngine;
```

4. Conclusion
-------------
The `RuleEngine.jsx` component integrates the frontend with the backend rule engine 
service. It allows users to create, evaluate, and manage rules seamlessly, enhancing 
the user experience by providing real-time feedback and visualizations.

This component ensures proper data flow between the frontend and backend through 
structured API calls, maintaining state management using React hooks.
