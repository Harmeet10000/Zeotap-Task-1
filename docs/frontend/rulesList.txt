RulesList.jsx Documentation
============================

This file provides the frontend logic for displaying and managing the list 
of rules in the application. It interacts with the backend to fetch rules and 
may offer options to update, delete, or evaluate individual rules.

---

1. Overview
-----------
The `RulesList.jsx` component likely displays a list of rules fetched from the backend. 
It may allow users to:

- View all available rules in the system.
- Select individual rules for detailed actions.
- Provide options to delete or edit rules.
- Trigger rule evaluation with provided input data.

---

2. Expected Functionalities
----------------------------
1. **Fetching Rules**:
   - Retrieves the list of rules from the backend API.
   - Displays rules along with their names and expressions.

2. **Selecting Rules**:
   - Allows users to select rules for actions like deletion, editing, or evaluation.

3. **Deleting a Rule**:
   - Sends a request to the backend to delete a rule.
   - Updates the list to reflect changes in real time.

4. **Evaluating a Rule**:
   - May offer the ability to input evaluation data and trigger backend rule evaluation.
   - Displays the eligibility result (true or false).

5. **UI State Management**:
   - Uses React hooks (like `useState` and `useEffect`) to manage state and side effects.

3. Example Code Snippet (Hypothetical)
--------------------------------------
```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { RuleService } from "../services/ruleAPI";

const RulesList = () => {
  const [rules, setRules] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchRules();
  }, []);

  const fetchRules = async () => {
    try {
      const data = await RuleService.getRules();
      setRules(data);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error fetching rules:", error);
    }
  };

  const handleDelete = async (id) => {
    try {
      await RuleService.deleteRule(id);
      setRules(rules.filter((rule) => rule._id !== id));
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error deleting rule:", error);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Rules List</h1>
      <ul>
        {rules.map((rule) => (
          <li key={rule._id}>
            {rule.ruleName}: {rule.ruleString}
            <button onClick={() => handleDelete(rule._id)}>Delete</button>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

export default RulesList;
```

The `RulesList.jsx` component serves as the primary interface for viewing and managing 
rules. It ensures seamless interaction with the backend for fetching, deleting, 
and possibly evaluating rules. By utilizing React hooks, it maintains state efficiently 
and provides a responsive user experience.

This component plays a vital role in managing rules within the frontend, offering 
real-time updates and feedback to the user through API calls.
